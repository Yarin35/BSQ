# BSQ
Biggest SQuare finder

For this project the goal is to find the biggest square full of 'star character' in a map filled with 'star character' and 'o' for the obstacles.
And thus the quickest/lightest possible.

USAGE:

-First you have to enter make re in the directory (to compile the files)

-Then your gonna choose a way to do it either with a map in a file or with a map of your choice

-To do with a map in a file you have to enter: ./bsq [map-file] and that's it the map solved (with the biggest square replaced by 'X') 
will be printed in your terminal.

-To use it with a original map that has  pattern of your choice you have to enter: ./bsq [size of map] [pattern] notice that the pattern 
has to be made of '.' and 'o'.

-If you wanna know how quick it is you can use "time" before the executable

-If you wanna redirect it to file for any reasons (it's quicker since you won't print in the terminal) you simply have to do "> [file-name]" after the command.
